This lesson has many exercises as discussions to prompt people to think about
the components of their genomics project and the workflow.

Discussions can happen between neighbors in a workshop. Then after paired discussion there can be a short general discussion of the types of things that came up in the discussion.

You could also have people enter responses to the discussion in the workshop etherpad. Or capture the general responses in that etherpad. That etherpad is then a resource for learners after the workshop.
